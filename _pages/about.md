I'm an MSci Theoretical Physics Student at UCL. I'm interested in the use of Applied Mathematics in multiple areas such as Finance and Computer Science. 
Currently, I’m researching the use of Kinetic Network Models to investigate the spread of the Covid-19 and analysing how the model reacts to government intervention techniques. 

In the past I have taken part in research internships such as “Using Scientific Computing Methods to investigate Anti-perovskites structures in cathode materials” and also financial internships such as “Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory.”
