I'm an MSci Theoretical Physics student at UCL. I'm interested in the use of quantitative methods in multiple areas such as Finance and Computer Science. 

Currently, for my masters thesis, I am researching Markov Models in Enhanced Sampling Method; I am looking at improving the enchances sampling methods.

In the past I have taken part in a research internship at the Faraday Institute investigating different anti-perovskites structures in cathode materials and also quantitative trading strategy intern at Rokos Capital Management.
